## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Boop enters Philippines market
**Mitigation:** Move fast, build local relationships, lock in suppliers early, focus on features they don't have (free planner)

### Risk 2: Suppliers prefer established platforms
**Mitigation:** Lower commission rates, better support, direct relationships, local presence

### Risk 3: Hard to acquire both supply (suppliers) and demand (travelers)
**Mitigation:** Chicken-and-egg problem - start with content to drive traffic, then convert to bookings

### Risk 4: Payment processing challenges
**Mitigation:** Use established local payment gateways (PayMongo, Xendit), multiple payment options

### Risk 5: Trust and safety issues
**Mitigation:** Verification process, reviews, secure payments, insurance options, customer support
